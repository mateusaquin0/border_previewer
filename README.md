# Border Previewer

This is a simple project to exercise my concepts of HMTL5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

It's a page to preview the effect of `border-radius` in each border of a box.

After the user press the button 'Previewer!', in the middle box will appear the necessarie CSS3 parameters to apply the same efect in another box.
